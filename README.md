# zurich-airport-ml

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset from Zurich Airport containing aircraft and arrival information. The aim was to reduce dimensionality and visualise key patterns in the data using Python.

## Overview

The notebook walks through the full pipeline:
- Importing and cleaning the dataset
- Handling categorical and numerical features
- Feature scaling and correlation analysis
- Applying PCA with scikit-learn
- Visualising explained variance and PCA components in 2D and 3D

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Files Included
- `Zurich-Airport-ML.ipynb`: main Jupyter notebook
- `Data Processing and PCA in Python Notebook.pdf`: PDF version of the notebook

This was part of a project on multivariate data analysis.
